file-transfer-server
====================

A simple file transfer service, in a client-server fashion, written using Python sockets.

This was written for an assignment in a 3rd year data communications and networking course at the University of Canterbury. My group partner for this assignment was Marco Politakis.

The finised program includes functionality to simulate resilience against packet losses of configurable probability.
